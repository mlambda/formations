\begin{frame}{Model Engineering}
  Several key aspects to consider:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Performance in production
  \item Various deployments with very distinct characteristics
  \item Interpretability
  \item Maintainability
  \item Compliance with regulations (non-discrimination, ...)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Best Practices}
  In an industrial context, the focus is on the data, not the model~:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Start simple (heuristic, simple model)
    \item Use the industry standard for the task given your performance and deployment requirements
    \item Improve data first, model second
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Model Card}
  Introduced in \bluelink{https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993}{\textit{Model Cards for Model Reporting}}~:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Specifies ethical and regulatory decisions related to the model
    \item Provides transparency
    \item Aims at informing both the public and internal teams
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Model Registry}
  Centralized place to store and retrieve models and associated meta-data~:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Eases deployment
    \item Solidifies reproducibility
  \end{itemize}
