\begin{frame}{Deployment Challenges}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Providing a trained model to a diverse \& large crowd
    \item With ML performance observed in quality tests
    \item With good classical performance (latency, throughput, ...)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Common Pitfalls}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Different code from development to handle incoming data in production
    \item Poor dependency management
    \item Inadequate architecture
  \end{itemize}
