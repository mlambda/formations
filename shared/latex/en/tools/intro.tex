\begin{frame}{Need for tooling}
  ML is at the crossroad between mathematics and engineering:
  \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item Handle experiments (models, data)
    \item Store big amounts of data
    \item Run complex learning algorithms in parallel
    \item Deploy to production
    \item â€¦
  \end{itemize}
  \onslide<+(1)->{$\rightarrow$ Tooling is extremely important to be efficient!}
