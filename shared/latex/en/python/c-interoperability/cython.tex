\begin{frame}{What is cython?}

    Cython approaches interoperability differently than ctypes.

    While \alert{ctypes} allows a Python program to access C functions, \alert{cython} is a translator Python to C.

    Cython will allow to generated C code and compile it without writting C code. In theory, it requires only knowledge on Python.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types}
    Defining a library with cython requires to specify variable types.
    \mintedpycode{python/c-interoperability/short-cython}
    
    Note: it is possible to type functions too.
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Building}
    Compiling code requires to be written in a \texttt{.pyx} file, then it is necessary to write a setup script :
    \mintedpycode{python/c-interoperability/setup-cython}\\

    Assuming the script is written in the file \texttt{setup.py}, following command will transform the python code and compile the resulting C code:

    \texttt{python setup.py build\_ext --inplace}
