\begin{frame}{What is \texttt{ctypes}?}
    \bluelink{https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html}{\texttt{ctypes}} is a standard library providing binding to foreign libraries with compatible data types.
    
    It allows calling functions from dynamic or shared libraries.\\

    Obviously, it requires knowledge in both C and Python.

\begin{frame}{Loading libraries}
    Loading libraries depends of the OS, so \texttt{ctypes} provides differents tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{CDLL} if it uses the standard calling convention
        \item \texttt{WinDLL} is limited to Windows. Functions in such libraries use the \texttt{stdcall} convention and return \texttt{int} by default.
        \item Other tools exists for specific cases (\texttt{OleDLL}, \texttt{PyDLL})
        \item \texttt{numpy} library proposes a similar sub library which is convenient to use it togehter with numpy structures
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Binding types}

    After loading a library, each function provided should be linked with its input types and output type.
