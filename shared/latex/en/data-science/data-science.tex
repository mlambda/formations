\begin{frame}{What is Data Science?}
  Tentative definition: harnessing value from data through analysis \& predictive modeling.

  Leverages techniques mainly from:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Big data
    \item Machine learning
    \item Data visualization
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference with Machine Learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Producing of reports and visuals of key insights for stakeholders is not a core ML task
    \item Using predictive modeling is just a mean to an end for data scientists
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference with Data Engineering}
  Data engineering teams make data scientists' work easier by:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Providing big data architecture
    \item Setting up a data model and data catalog
    \item â€¦
  \end{itemize}

  But they are not focused on delivering insight from data.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Difference with Business Analysis}
  Extremely close.

  Main difference is the extent of the use of predictive modeling.
